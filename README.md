# reversemd5
A reverse-md5 lookup database for the web, which adds user string-to-md5 queries to the the database.

Database is MySQL, original data rendered in Python, server side code is PHP, the client is HTML, Css, and JavaScript, and uses AJAX for server queries.

I've transfered the (old) project to github, and now making the code a bit nicer and more correct.
