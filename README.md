reversemd5
==========


This is a one-page site which checks a databases for reverse md5-sums,
and offers md5 strings calculations, which it adds to the database.

It is made up out of small amounts of each of:
html, css, php, javascript, jquery, ajax, mysql and python.


Thanks to Paul Jhonston et al whose JavaScript implementation of the MD5 function is used here.
(details in public/md5-min.js)

See my implementation at http://reversemd5.com
